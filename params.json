  "body": "# GloSC\r\n\r\nGlosSC or Global SteamController is a small set of tools that allows you to use your SteamController as a systemwide XInput-controller alongside a systemwide (borderless window) Steam overlay\r\nAll complete with **per application bindings and working rumble emulation.**\r\n\r\nGloSC can also launch any of your favorite Games and directly add them to Steam, be it Win32 or UWP!\r\n\r\nIt is **the tool** to enjoy any Game that has trouble with Steam and add extra functionality to your SteamController\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n## FAQ / Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n* **Q: The overlay isn't showing up!**\r\n  A: The overlay only works for windowed or borderless windowed mode applications. Nothing much I can do here.\r\n     This is even true for UWP-Games! While it's true that UWP doesn't run exclusive fullscreen, they don't run, strictly speaking, classical borderless window either\r\n     Try running your games as borderless window\r\n     \r\n* **Q: Audio turns off when using this**\r\n  A: ViGEm emulates a full X360-controller incl. peripherals\r\n  Go to your windows sound mixer and reset you default playback device - It should be fixed, even for the next shortcut launches\r\n\r\n* **Q: Hitting the Steam Button + RT to take a screenshot doesn't work**\r\n  A: Another limitation that most likely won't be fixed, even if Steam would take a screenshot, you'd most likely get just a blank image\r\n\r\n* **Q: UWP Games don't launch in foreground**\r\n  A: For some reason trying to launch them in foreground stops them fron launching entirely\r\n     For now use alt+tab via Steam-chords\r\n     This is currently beeing investigated\r\n  \r\n* **Q: When using big picture the controller switches to desktop-config**\r\n  A: Don't really know why this is happening\r\n     For now launch your GloSC shortcuts via Steam desktop mode\r\n     This is currently beeing investigated\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is built using [Qt 5.7](https://www.qt.io/) and uses [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) for drawing the overlay\r\n\r\nThe systemwide Xbox-Controller works via [ViGEm](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEm)\r\n\r\nGloSC consists of:\r\n \r\n * A main application (\"GloSC\") allowing you to create and configure new shortcuts or \"SteamTargets\" and automatically add them to Steam\r\n * The \"GloSC-GameLauncher\" which can launch Win32 and UWP games and mainly exists to work around dual overlays\r\n * The \"SteamTarget\" which does most of the magic - Showing the overlay to the user as well as talking to the ViGEm-driver for systemwide Controller emulation\r\n\r\n \r\nLike my stuff?
