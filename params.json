  "body": "# GloSC\r\n\r\nGlosSC or Global SteamController is a little set of tools that allows you to use your SteamController as a systemwide XInput-controller alongside a systemwide (borderless window) Steam overlay with **per application bindings and working rumble emulation.**\r\n\r\nThe systemwide Xbox-Controller works via [ViGEm](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEm)\r\n\r\nIt is built using [Qt 5.7](https://www.qt.io/) and uses [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) for drawing the overlay\r\n\r\n\r\nGloSC consists of:\r\n \r\n * A main application (\"GloSC\") allowing you to create and configure new shortcuts or \"SteamTargets\" and (at a later date) automatically add them to Steam\r\n * The \"GloSC-GameLauncher\" which can launch Win32 and UWP games and mainly exists to work around dual overlays\r\n * The \"SteamTarget\" which does most of the magic - Showing the overlay to the user as well as talking to the ViGEm-driver for systemwide Controller emulation\r\n\r\n \r\nLike my stuff?
