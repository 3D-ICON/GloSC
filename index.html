<p>GlosSC or Global SteamController is a small set of tools that allows you to use your SteamController as a systemwide XInput-controller alongside a systemwide (borderless window) Steam overlay
All complete with <strong>per application bindings and working rumble emulation.</strong></p>

<p>GloSC can also launch any of your favorite Games and directly add them to Steam, be it Win32 or UWP!</p>

<p>It is <strong>the tool</strong> to enjoy any Game that has trouble with Steam and add extra functionality to your SteamController</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q: The overlay isn't showing up!</strong>
A: The overlay only works for windowed or borderless windowed mode applications. Nothing much I can do here.
   This is even true for UWP-Games! While it's true that UWP doesn't run exclusive fullscreen, they don't run, strictly speaking, classical borderless window either
   Try running your games as borderless window</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q: Audio turns off when using this</strong>
A: ViGEm emulates a full X360-controller incl. peripherals
Go to your windows sound mixer and reset you default playback device - It should be fixed, even for the next shortcut launches</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q: Hitting the Steam Button + RT to take a screenshot doesn't work</strong>
A: Another limitation that most likely won't be fixed, even if Steam would take a screenshot, you'd most likely get just a blank image</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q: UWP Games don't launch in foreground</strong>
A: For some reason trying to launch them in foreground stops them fron launching entirely
   For now use alt+tab via Steam-chords
   This is currently beeing investigated</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q: When using big picture the controller switches to desktop-config</strong>
A: Don't really know why this is happening
   For now launch your GloSC shortcuts via Steam desktop mode
   This is currently beeing investigated</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is built using <a href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt 5.7</a> and uses <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a> for drawing the overlay</p>

<p>The systemwide Xbox-Controller works via <a href="https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEm">ViGEm</a></p>

<p>GloSC consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>A main application ("GloSC") allowing you to create and configure new shortcuts or "SteamTargets" and automatically add them to Steam</li>
<li>The "GloSC-GameLauncher" which can launch Win32 and UWP games and mainly exists to work around dual overlays</li>
<li>The "SteamTarget" which does most of the magic - Showing the overlay to the user as well as talking to the ViGEm-driver for systemwide Controller emulation</li>
</ul>
